# deformaball

Deformable Ball Music Controller prototype from the User Interface Technologies group.

DeformaBall is a ball shaped musical controller that can be used to modulate audio when touched and squeezed (See Figure 1).

The ball explores some of the gestures that our hands are capable of. This deviates from usual musical input devices, as the input interface is a fabric material that responds to applied pressure.

We aimed for the DeformaBall to be a fun, simple to use controller, which gives the user a novel way to interact with sound.


The technology is implemented with open-source Arduino code, and using max patches to interface with Ableton Live.

Attached to the repository is the final paper describing the project.
